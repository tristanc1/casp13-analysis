# casp13-analysis
Some rough-and-ready code for analysing CASP13 results. Requires ChimeraX and ISOLDE.

A collection of code (designed to be run from within a session of ChimeraX with the ISOLDE plugin installed) for analysing the results of CASP experiments. Allows scoring of decoys on their similarity to the target model in torsion space, combination of these scores with traditional CASP scoring metrics, and plotting of results in various ways. Note that some directory names are hard-coded and will need to be changed to run on a different machine.
